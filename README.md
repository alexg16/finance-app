# Finance Tool Web Application

## Overview
The Finance Tool is a web application designed to help users manage their personal finances. The tool allows users to add, edit, and delete transactions, set monthly budgets, and view their transaction history. It provides a dashboard summarizing income, expenses, and remaining budget, offering users an insightful look into their financial status. The project leverages Django for the back-end, and it integrates JavaScript on the front-end for client-side validation. The application is mobile-responsive, ensuring usability across devices.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

### Distinctiveness
This project is distinct from other CS50W projects in several key aspects:

- **Purpose and Functionality**: Unlike Project 2 (E-commerce) or Project 4 (Social Network), this project is focused on personal financial management, allowing users to track income, expenses, and set budgets. It does not involve user-to-user interactions or a marketplace.
- **Data Aggregation**: The dashboard aggregates and displays financial data, including income and expenses by category, and calculates the budget remaining, which adds significant functionality compared to standard CRUD operations in other projects.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: The transaction history includes dynamic filtering options, such as filtering by type, category, and date range, which goes beyond simple data display.

### Complexity
This project satisfies the complexity requirement through:

- **Multiple Models**: The project utilizes three distinct models: Category, Transaction, and Budget, each with different relationships and constraints.
- **User Authentication**: The project implements user authentication with custom views for login, logout, and registration.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented for transactions, complete with form validation and user-specific data handling.
- **JavaScript Validation**: Custom JavaScript is used for client-side form validation, enhancing user experience by preventing invalid submissions.
- **Data Visualization**: The dashboard aggregates and displays monthly income and expenses, and calculates remaining budget dynamically based on user data.

## File Descriptions

### models.py
Defines three models:

- **Category**: Represents a category of transactions (e.g., "Groceries").
- **Transaction**: Represents an individual transaction with fields for amount, date, type (income/expense), category, and description.
- **Budget**: Represents a userâ€™s budget for a specific month and year, ensuring each user has a unique budget for each period.

### views.py
Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and rendering templates:

- **dashboard**: Displays the user's total income, expenses, and remaining budget.
- **add_transaction**: Handles adding new transactions.
- **transaction_history**: Lists all user transactions with filtering options.
- **edit_transaction**: Allows users to edit existing transactions.
- **delete_transaction**: Handles transaction deletion with a confirmation prompt.
- **set_budget**: Allows users to set their monthly budget.
- **login_view, logout_view, register**: Manage user authentication.

### forms.py
Defines forms used for user input:

- **TransactionForm**: Handles input for transactions.
- **BudgetForm**: Handles input for setting budgets.

### templates/budget/

- **layout.html**: Base template for consistent structure across all pages.
- **dashboard.html**: Displays financial summaries (income, expenses, budget remaining).
- **add_transaction.html**: Form for adding new transactions.
- **transaction_history.html**: Lists and filters transactions.
- **edit_transaction.html**: Form for editing transactions.
- **delete_transaction.html**: Confirmation page for deleting transactions.
- **login.html**: User login form.
- **register.html**: User registration form.
- **set_budget.html**: Form for setting monthly budgets.

### admin.py
Registers models in the Django admin interface for data management.
